            Mission We help people to hack their own futures. What does that
            mean exactly? HackYourFuture addresses the need for more
            web-developers and diversity in the tech industry in Denmark. It
            does this by offering relevant tech education to individuals facing
            challenging situations that prevent them from fulfilling their
            professional potential. Thereby we bridge the gap to the labour
            market, making employment as a web-developer possible. So what makes
            the organization unique? Our success criterion is not graduation,
            but employment. Our teachers and mentors are professional
            web-developers that take the responsibility to share their knowledge
            and passion for technology with people who need it the most. We
            treat everyone equally, while also acknowledging the different
            backgrounds of our students. We offer equal opportunities to
            everyone by creating a supportive and inclusive learning community.
            Our screening and selection process considers both technical skill
            and the degree of marginalisation of the applicant. Where others may
            see liability, we see potential. We change the perception of what
            our students can achieve in Denmark through ambitious and meaningful
            projects. We create and celebrate role models that coming
            generations can aspire to. We want to create a lasting impact on the
            lives of our students and thus their social surroundings. We donâ€™t
            give up on anybody easily.
